# QA Automation Learning Journey

This repository documents my progression into JavaScript, automation, and Playwright-based testing.

Each folder represents a milestone in capability development—with reflections, exercises, and working artifacts demonstrating understanding and growth rather than polished end results.

## Structure

- `01-js-fundamentals/` — Language foundations and syntax fluency
- `02-playwright-fundamentals/` — Core automation test skills (coming soon)

## Purpose

This repo acts as both:
- A knowledge portfolio
- A public learning journal
- A demonstration of my ability to practice, iterate, and grow intentionally as an automation engineer
