# QA Automation Learning Journey

This repository documents my intentional progression into JavaScript-based test automation, with a focus on Playwright.

Rather than showcasing polished or production-ready frameworks, this repo captures **how I learn**—through small experiments, reflection, and working examples that demonstrate understanding and growth over time.

## Structure

- **01-js-fundamentals/**  
  Language foundations, syntax fluency, and problem-solving exercises

- **02-playwright-fundamentals/**  
  Core Playwright concepts, test structure, locators, assertions, and exploratory automation patterns *(in progress)*

- **03-tests**  
  The currently active repository where my explorations will live.
  

## Purpose

This repository serves as:

- A learning portfolio
- A public learning journal
- Evidence of my ability to practice deliberately, iterate quickly, and grow intentionally as an automation-focused QA engineer.

Best Practices for a README

A README documents how tests work, not secrets they rely on.

✅ Good / common

How to run tests

Environment setup

Test scope & assumptions

Known issues / test data notes

Non-sensitive example users (e.g. standard_user, locked_out_user)

Where credentials come from (env vars, secrets manager)

⚠️ Conditionally acceptable

Fake / public demo credentials
(e.g. Sauce Demo–style accounts that are intentionally public)

❌ Not appropriate

Real usernames & passwords

Production or staging credentials

Anything that would rotate or grant real access
