# QA Automation Learning Journey

This repository documents my intentional progression into JavaScript-based test automation, with a focus on Playwright.

Rather than showcasing polished or production-ready frameworks, this repo captures **how I learn**—through small experiments, reflection, and working examples that demonstrate understanding and growth over time.

## Structure

- **01-js-fundamentals/**  
  Language foundations, syntax fluency, and problem-solving exercises

- **02-playwright-fundamentals/**  
  Core Playwright concepts, test structure, locators, assertions, and exploratory automation patterns *(in progress)*

## Purpose

This repository serves as:

- A learning portfolio
- A public learning journal
- Evidence of my ability to practice deliberately, iterate quickly, and grow intentionally as an automation-focused QA engineer
