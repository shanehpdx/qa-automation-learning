# Day 1 — Reflection
"I do not test with my hand; 
he who tests with his hand has forgotten the face of his father. 

I test with my eye. 

I do not test with my hand; he who tests with his hand has forgotten the face of his father. 

I test with my mind. 

I do not test with my code; he who test with his code has forgotten the face of his father. 

I test with my heart and mind"

'The Test Automaters Creed' adapted from Stephen King's 'Gunslingers Creed' documented in The Dark Tower series.  

## What I accomplished:
✔ Installed Node.js and confirmed working execution  
✔ Learned variable rules (`let` vs `const`)  
✔ Wrote functions and executed conditional logic  
✔ Filtered arrays and evaluated results  
✔ Created objects and validated permission behavior  
✔ Wrote an arrow function as modern syntax  
✔ Debugged missing comma syntax error using IntelliSense  

## Why this matters:
These foundational patterns mirror automation logic — validating states, transforming data, and structuring reusable logic.

## Notes
IntelliSense isn’t just autocompletion — it functions as a tutor. It explained my syntax bug (missing comma) and taught structural rules.

Major Epiphany in using github as the place to record notes on my learnings.
